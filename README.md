# DyeHard

In this project, we create a website version of the game **DyeHard**. The game is about an alien squid trying to escape its aquarium-like facility. To do so, the squid must change colors using colored orbs. The colors grant the player abilities but also limitations. The goal is to find the right color and escape.

## Features
This game includes several features:
- A list of pre-made levels acting as a tutorial.
- A level editor allowing players to create, share, and export custom levels.

### Goal: Replayability
We aim to make the game highly replayable by combining procedural content generation (PCG), creative puzzles, and changing gameplay mechanics.

## Thesis Project
This game is part of my thesis project on replayability and AI-driven level design. Using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we generate levels that can be played via the import function, showcasing the AIâ€™s ability to create engaging and varied experiences.

## How to Play?
- Use arrow keys or WASD to move the alien.
- Collect colored orbs to change your hue.
- Solve puzzles by matching colors to pass through doors.
- Avoid or fight enemies using your color abilities.
- Reach the exit to complete the level.

## Where to Play?
Coming soon..
